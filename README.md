# Knowledge-Graph

This is an ongoing and temporary repo to represent __Knowledge-Graph__ which will be used for __BitTigerInst__ in future. The primary goal of __Knowledge-Graph__ is to offer the index or path (with resources) that you can follow to achieve your goal (e.g. finish a project, learn the skills specified for a certain career goal).

We try to focus on three fields firstly, which are also the starting folders/ports:

+ Data Science
+ Full Stack
+ System Design
